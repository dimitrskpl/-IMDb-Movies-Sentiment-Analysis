# IMDb-Movies-Sentiment-Analysis 🍿👀📽
In this project I develop a sentiment classifier using logistic regression for the dataset 
[imdb-reviews.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16TrTTwS0KTnqPFHC6TQm0ZGCHn5biA7E/view?usp=share_link). Each row in the dataset contains a URL for an IMDb movie (https://www.imdb.com/), a score between 0.0 and 10.0 and a review text. The classifier deals with 2 classes: negative sentiment (score between 0.0 and 4.0) and positive sentiment (score between 7.0 and 10.0). There are no reviews with intermediate scores in the dataset.
